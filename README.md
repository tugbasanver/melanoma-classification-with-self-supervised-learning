# melanoma-classification-with-self-supervised-learning

In this study, I propose improving the performance metrics of a binary classification problem, which uses the SIIM-ISIC 2020 and the SIIM-ISIC 2019 Challenge data, by enhancing the pretraining and training conduit approaches to the skin lesion recognition problem. For this purpose, 20 training experiments are conducted using the BYOL approach with various supervised backbone architectures and several implementation combinations of oversampling datasets, different data augmentations, multiple learning rates and batch sizes. My best-performed models overperformed the results of a similar study (Pathak et al., 2022) with the same model structure. My outperforming results are 83.57 G-mean and 80.66 sensitivity metrics for the best threshold settings and 80.99 G-mean and 84.18 sensitivity scores for the standard threshold settings of the BYOL model with the Resnet-101 supervised backbone. My other successful results contain 90.53 sensitivity and 82.99 G-mean scores for the standard threshold settings of the BYOL model with the Resnet-152 supervised backbone.
